# Swift-clean-files

Simple swift app to clean old files from a directory tree

## Disclamer

this is just an experiment on building OSX command line apps
this task can be accomplished easily and better with a bash script :)

## TODO

* project depencencies are included poorly and in the wrong places
* rename executable
